# Whitelisting StatusApp IP Addresses

To ensure uninterrupted monitoring and alerting, please whitelist the following StatusApp IP addresses on your endpoints, firewalls, or security appliances. Our monitoring checks originate from these IPs across different regions.

## Why Whitelist StatusApp IPs?
Whitelisting these IPs allows StatusApp to reliably access your services for uptime checks, incident detection, and notifications. This prevents false positives due to blocked requests and ensures accurate monitoring.
